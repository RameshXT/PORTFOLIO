            <h1>Poojitha,</h1>
            <p>
                Iâ€™m not sure where to start because itâ€™s hard to put my feelings into words. Saying goodbye is never easy.., especially to someone as special as you. Weâ€™ve shared so many things.., memories.., everything and even though youâ€™ll be away from me.., those memories will always stay close to me and hitting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks for being an amazing friend or something I donâ€™t know about our relationship.., for all the laughter.., the talks.., and the moments weâ€™ve had. Even though we may not see each other anymore.., our friendship or something will always stay strong.
            </p>
            <p>
                You know how I am if someone gives me attention.., Iâ€™ll respond with more respect. Thatâ€™s what happened with you. Then it became into friendship.., love.., and lust.
            </p>
            <p>
                I initially had only loving intentions with you.., but when you asked.., things changed. So, don't feel bad about it. It's just part of human nature.
            </p>
            <p>
                I thought Iâ€™d love you as long as I had breath.., but I lost that love.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love taking care of you every time. At least once.., I want to spend an entire day with you where I can take care of you.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Hey if possible.., sing for me with your sweetest voice. OK.., Iâ€™ll stop hereðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… otherwise., Iâ€™ll be typing something more about you and me it wont be stop.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wishing you all the best for the future. Take care., and remember.., this is not goodbye forever.., just for now.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a deepest one side love,<br>
                MeðŸ˜Š
